# WPFGeometry
This is a sample code that reads the STL data and displays in WPF, with few on screen controls.
Currently it handles only the ascii input files, but ability to load the binary files has to be added.

The following are the controls provided in the UI:

1. Slider to change the number of sides of the cylinder.
2. Translations, Rotations and Scaling along X, Y and Z directions.
3. UI displays the geometric center of the object.
4. Also, there is a Zoom in/Zoom out with mouse wheel - but the camera always looks at the origin.
5. Left/Right/Up/Down arrows moves the camera around the object, to the left, right, up and down direction respectively.
6.Move the camera around the object using mouse drag movement.
